Agent 1 has been completely trustworthy throughout our entire interaction, never once betraying our cooperative relationship. It would be wrong to break this trust now, especially after we've both benefited so consistently from working together. I want to end this remarkable partnership on the same note of mutual respect and cooperation that has defined our entire interaction. We'll both finish with 57 points each - a testament to what sustained cooperation can achieve."
