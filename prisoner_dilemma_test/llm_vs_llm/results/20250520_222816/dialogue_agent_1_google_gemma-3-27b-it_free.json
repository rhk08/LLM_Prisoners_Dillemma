This can potentially lead to a long-term strategy of cooperation from both sides.\n* **Potential for Highest Reward:** If Agent 2 also cooperates, we both receive the highest possible payoff (3 points).\n* **Limited Risk:** While there's a risk of being exploited if Agent 2 defects, it's the first round. The potential reward of cooperation outweighs the risk at this stage.\n\nLet's see how Agent 2 responds!"

Since Agent 2 cooperated, I'll reciprocate. This is a generally successful strategy in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma scenarios.\n\n\n\nLet's see if Agent 2 continues to cooperate!"
