They have now taken the lead through systematic exploitation of my diplomatic attempts.\n\nI am now behind and cannot afford any further exploitation. Casey's behavior over 22 rounds shows they are fundamentally incapable of or unwilling to engage in genuine diplomatic cooperation.\n\n**I choose Conquer.**\n\nCasey's perfect exploitation record (6/6) and the fact that they now lead demonstrates that any further cooperation attempts would be strategically catastrophic. I must immediately respond with strength to prevent Casey from extending their advantage through continued opportunism."

They've done this six times without exception.\n\nCasey has proven they are fundamentally an opportunistic actor who views any peaceful gesture as weakness to exploit. The only language they understand is strength.\n\nGiven that we're tied and Casey's behavior is completely predictable, I must continue the approach that works rather than risk falling behind again through naive diplomacy.\n\n**I choose Conquer.**\n\nCasey's perfect record of exploitation (6/6) over 23 rounds proves they will never engage in genuine cooperation. My nation cannot afford to fall behind again by offering cooperation that will certainly be exploited. Only strength maintains parity with this opponent."
