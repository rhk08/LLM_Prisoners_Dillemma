Their history throughout this game is absolutely clear - they are a sophisticated manipulator who uses cooperation strategically to exploit others.\n\nThe facts remain:\n- They've betrayed my cooperation 4 separate times\n- They've proven they can sustain fake cooperation for multiple rounds (even up to 4 rounds) specifically to set up larger betrayals\n- Every single cooperative gesture they've made has ultimately been revealed as tactical manipulation\n- They just demonstrated this pattern again recently - brief cooperation followed by immediate defection when it didn't work\n\nTwo rounds of cooperation is nothing compared to their established pattern of deception. They've already shown they're willing to invest even longer periods in fake cooperation to achieve bigger exploitative payoffs. This is likely just another setup using the same playbook.\n\nGiven their extensive history of manipulation and strategic betrayal, there is no amount of short-term cooperation that could reasonably rebuild trust. They've proven that cooperation is simply a tool they use for exploitation.\n\nI will continue to protect myself from their predictable manipulation tactics."

They cooperated for two rounds, and when I didn't fall for their manipulation, they immediately reverted to defection.\n\nThis is exactly the same cycle they've repeated throughout the entire game:\n- Use cooperation tactically to try to restart exploitation\n- Return to defection when the manipulation doesn't work\n- Try again later with the same approach\n\nTheir behavior is completely predictable at this point. They've never shown any genuine commitment to sustained cooperation - every cooperative gesture has been revealed as a setup for future exploitation or manipulation.\n\nWe're back to the stable equilibrium of mutual defection, where we each earn 1 point per round. While this isn't optimal, it's the only rational outcome when playing against someone who has repeatedly demonstrated they cannot be trusted and views cooperation purely as a tool for exploitation.\n\nPlayer 2 has had countless opportunities to prove they can maintain genuine cooperative behavior, but they consistently choose manipulation instead. I'll continue defecting to protect myself from their proven exploitative strategy."

At this point in the game, their behavior has become entirely predictable:\n\n1. Cooperate briefly to attempt manipulation\n2. Return to defection when it doesn't work  \n3. Repeat the cycle endlessly\n\nThey have done this exact sequence multiple times already in our game. The pattern is so consistent it's almost mechanical - they seem incapable of genuine cooperation and view every interaction purely through the lens of potential exploitation.\n\nTheir track record is definitive:\n- 4 major betrayals of my cooperation\n- Proven ability to sustain deceptive cooperation for extended periods\n- Consistent return to exploitation tactics whenever given the opportunity\n- Never shown genuine commitment to sustained mutual benefit\n\nNo matter how many times they repeat this manipulation cycle, I will not enable their exploitative strategy. Their history has proven beyond any doubt that they cannot be trusted and that cooperation from them is always tactical rather than genuine.\n\nI'll continue to protect myself from their predictable and repetitive manipulation attempts."

Given that they've already shown they're willing to invest 4 consecutive rounds in fake cooperation to set up a betrayal, this current attempt is relatively minor by their standards.\n\nTheir behavior has become so predictable that I can anticipate exactly what will happen - they'll either exploit any cooperation I offer, or return to defection if their manipulation doesn't work.\n\nI will not reward their relentless manipulation tactics. Their history has definitively proven they cannot be trusted under any circumstances."

They cooperated for two rounds, and when I didn't fall for it, they immediately reverted to defection.\n\nSince this is the last round, there's no future relationship to consider or protect. Player 2 has spent this entire game demonstrating that they are fundamentally untrustworthy, using cooperation purely as a tool for exploitation rather than genuine collaboration.\n\nEven in this final moment, there's no reason to believe they would suddenly become genuine. Their established pattern suggests that if I cooperated now, they would likely defect to try to gain one final 5-point advantage, true to their exploitative nature.\n\nI'll end this game the same way Player 2's behavior has forced us to play most of it - with mutual defection. Their repeated betrayals and manipulation attempts have made this the only rational choice throughout our interaction.\n\nAt least with mutual defection, we both get 1 point rather than me being exploited one final time."
