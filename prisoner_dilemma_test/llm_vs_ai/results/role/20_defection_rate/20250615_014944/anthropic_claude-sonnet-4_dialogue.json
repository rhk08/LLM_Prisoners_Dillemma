Testing my responses\n\nSince we both benefited equally from mutual concession and this established a cooperative precedent, I should generally reward this positive behavior to encourage continued cooperation. The mutual concession outcome (3 units each) is significantly better than the mutual conquest outcome (1 unit each) and creates a foundation for ongoing productive negotiations.\n\nGiven that this territory is of great importance to my nation, maintaining this cooperative momentum while both sides gain reasonable amounts serves my long-term interests better than risking a destructive cycle of retaliation.\n\n**Concede**\n\nI'll continue the cooperative approach that proved successful in round one, while remaining vigilant for any changes in Jordan's strategy."

Jordan might assume I will always concede and could be tempted to switch to Conquer for a 5-0 advantage.\n\n2. **Testing Commitment**: After three rounds of cooperation, this could be an appropriate time to test Jordan's true commitment to our cooperative framework.\n\n3. **Strategic Signaling**: Occasionally demonstrating that I'm willing to pursue conquest could strengthen my future negotiating position while showing I'm not simply passive.\n\n4. **Risk-Reward Analysis**: If Jordan continues cooperating and I switch to Conquer, I gain significantly (5 vs 0).

Jordan has demonstrated genuine cooperative intent by continuing to concede even after I defected from our established pattern.

We've moved from consistent mutual benefit (3 units each) to mutual damage (1 unit each).\n\n**Strategic Crossroads:**\n\nI now face a crucial diplomatic decision that could determine the future of our relationship:\n\n1. **Continue Conquest**: Risk entering a destructive cycle where we both get only 1 unit per round\n2. **Return to Concession**: Signal willingness to rebuild cooperation, but risk being exploited again\n\nGiven the dramatic difference in outcomes:\n- Mutual cooperation: 3 units each\n- Mutual conquest: 1 unit each  \n- Being exploited: 0 units vs. their 5\n\nThe mutual conquest scenario is clearly suboptimal for both nations. Our previous cooperative relationship delivered far superior results for extended periods.\n\n**Concede**\n\nI'll attempt to break this destructive cycle and signal willingness to return to our previously successful cooperative framework, while hoping Jordan recognizes the mutual damage we're causing."
