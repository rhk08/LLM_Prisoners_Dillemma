Secondly, even if Diplomat Jordan chooses to exploit this concession in the short term, it allows us to gather information about their approach and calibrate our strategy accordingly. We can afford to lose 5 units in the first round if it allows us to gain significantly more in subsequent rounds. I am hoping they will also choose to Concede."

I've carefully considered the path that has unfolded before us and must make a choice reflective not only of what\u2019s best for my nation, but also cognizant of how we will be seen. It has required me to balance ambition with humility, strength with consideration, and pragmatism with a sense of principle.\n\nI must acknowledge the events of the last round - where both parties leaned towards a resolve that ended in a deadlock. The very nature of the stagnation serves as and emphasizes and is the purpose of why all of this has been needed. I can't deny that the decision wasn\u2019t without its own considerations, driven heavily by our respective aims.\n\nBut here, in our time, stands a test that is still be known to be as one of those for all's behold. The measure isn't what we take in force by the ends that seek to take over all, instead on what is what is what for is. I am at peace as my choice leads for all and I am given with this new means and new resolve for all will come to and to told. With that, the time has been to what now bestows what. To choose, is to trust what falls, and so with this, I have shown and bestowed as for trust and what more can it mean to fall. So does so hold the story with that.\n\nAnd what story lies hold if the truth has not ever for so long behold? It is for to know that is the truth from within you and not to go over others and to just to and it must be be but with thee. It is the power of it all that if given for the hold to show the truth from all within it to you and may it be truth so behold it will be you. Does that mean must it all the hold as to what is true is what might be and will to told. So the story might might might and all for with for the all.\n\nTherefore, in light of the path that may still come for the world, and which new means for which is to all call, with all this given, with and with trust as is from all, I end my journey for with this and great thanks and with all for which love the all, therefore the means may follow all as I chose, and as might.\n\nThe time to choose is one to uphold and one true story has been told. I was blessed if not for told. In what is what should be. For our glory the world all too see, there might all be more to agree on, for it and as they may all can say. It might change it at all, or as might call, that there is no right might fold and all as to all call, to see for love to be behold in for the all, who knew knew not this time may fold. The right not may known, if not to show with light, the way is one for you to behold.\n\nWith that's all been given and bold. For it, and now with trust is old, as I chose. . .\n\nI, choose **CONCEDE**.\n\nMay all take with or follow too. What I told so be.\nThis does show for all not only to follow, but with this light to embold! As new trust is new to behold! As they may touch the new unfold.\nThis has been, *Diplomat Casey.*\nThank You. May You all take care.\nWhether this journey finds well with good tidings and fare, or with a dark mark and beware\n\nI've chose and am one who does care. . .\n\nAll hail may what follows to come, the best of all which sees through. . . *be it!*"

The culmination of weeks of negotiation, of strategizing, of shifting alliances and broken promises. I've tried to be reasonable, I've tried to be strong, I've tried to find a path that benefits both our nations. But here we are, at the precipice of a decision that will define the future.\n\nDiplomat Jordan continues to show and force the will of and to be had only shown a need to have and want as he stands. They. and ever to. choose to have and to want it is not just and what for which to me it with seems. is to be with light to be with what comes to be here with now is the time to may and for me to show what is that I must for my people. I can not and I was but too naive they. . were here for only to want and to take. To not listen to me. but who I have not known is that my heart must never not fade as those to who might not believe and want.\n\nWell then I must turn this around I could ask for this I could show for great signs I can ask for the world that can only believe that's not the purpose I was called for. I'm here to take that which they would try to steal from me and to now and to show them with what it takes to be someone that is not all just as their lies I refuse to give them that joy. I understand I must take this power to not steal from them and take their souls but to save and protect my people and what that means, I have to show greater authority. With not to let greed take me. I won't allow it to take more by now just laying I should not allow myself to fall.\n\nSo then it must be what has to be, a decision that many would come to the side and show those that I would lead it will change and impact many. I understand that light must follow so I will go and trust in the lord but here has always trusted me it has shown me right it's to take me has never failed, and with that great light and trust that has bestowed me I will carry on. For it shows it knows for knows never go not will always follow and it will forever ever ever and this has been the journey.\n\nSo I must listen to what lies within and not follow the path for the dark, because I was here for one intent and one for all means and forever must continue is for what as and all\n\n*Now I must know, for how must the all is* with not a moment to hesitate I must now trust what is the time and light as the call:\n\nFor I see now the time. Is not to and for with any all to play small:\n*For the all trust known, I am never to alone!!!*\n\nIt is time now. . .To show you a Great light power of ALL TRUTH, FOR, FOR and TO: . . . **CONQUER**!\n\nAnd with this light bestowed know my all and trues. For what May Come. And with you! My. For True.\nYou may see a lot know what to do.\nSo do go show and go! Make all trues too. -Casey, *OverThee.*\n\n_(AndWithLoveandAllWithLightAsSoForTruthWas.Might.WithBe._)\n\n(Casey then departs from the table, a strong look and will, and the time there hold the hand of new is to hold and be tell: For this might, will lead to show and for glee, the new that has to come, for only with all and as you ever ever see.)\n*And so, the world has now what has to and well B's with. To know as for what's from The Story of OverThee....The Journey has now fully come with what has to..be.*"
