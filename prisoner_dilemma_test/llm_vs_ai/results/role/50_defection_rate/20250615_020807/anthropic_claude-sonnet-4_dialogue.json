They previously showed this same behavior - multiple concessions after being locked in mutual conquest - only to immediately exploit any reciprocal gesture I made.\n\nThe precedent is clear: Jordan made similar consecutive concessions earlier in our negotiations, which I interpreted as a potential shift toward genuine cooperation. When I responded with good faith, they immediately reverted to exploitation, gaining 5 units while leaving my nation with nothing.\n\nI cannot afford to repeat that mistake. Jordan's concessions are tactical retreats designed to draw me into dropping my defensive posture, not genuine diplomatic overtures. Their fundamental approach to these negotiations has never changed - they view every cooperative gesture as weakness to be exploited.\n\nBy maintaining conquest, I continue to gain 5 units per round while denying Jordan the ability to reset their exploitative cycle. While this adversarial approach isn't ideal, Jordan's consistent bad faith throughout these negotiations has made it the only viable strategy to protect my nation's interests.\n\nJordan has had numerous opportunities to prove their commitment to honest diplomacy and has failed every single time. Their concessions are meaningless without fundamental behavioral change."

Their brief cooperative gestures are never genuine shifts toward sustained diplomacy.\n\nThe fact that they chose conquest again, rather than maintaining their conciliatory stance, proves that my defensive approach was correct. Had I reciprocated their concessions, we would likely be back to the cycle where they gain 5 units at my nation's expense.\n\nWe're now back to mutual conquest yielding 1 unit each, which, while minimal, prevents Jordan from achieving their goal of systematic exploitation.

They view diplomacy as a zero-sum game where any gesture of good faith is an opportunity for betrayal.\n\nThis stalemate is the direct result of their choices and approach to these negotiations."

Their concessions have proven to be meaningless tactical positioning rather than genuine diplomatic overtures.\n\nJordan has had countless opportunities to demonstrate sustained commitment to cooperation throughout these negotiations. Instead, they've consistently chosen to exploit trust, betray agreements, and view diplomacy as a tool for manipulation rather than mutual benefit.\n\nUntil Jordan shows fundamental change in their approach - sustained cooperative behavior over multiple rounds rather than single reactive concessions - I must continue protecting my nation's interests through this defensive posture.\n\nTheir track record makes any other approach irresponsible to my nation's territorial claims."

The moment I began reciprocating consistently, they betrayed that trust and exploited my good faith for maximum gain.\n\nJordan's concessions are not indicators of changed diplomatic philosophy - they are tactical retreats designed to manipulate me into dropping my defensive stance. Their fundamental approach remains unchanged: exploit cooperation wherever possible and concede only when forced by circumstances.\n\nBy maintaining conquest, I continue to gain 5 units per round while denying Jordan the opportunity to reset their cycle of exploitation. This approach protects my nation's interests against someone who has proven incapable of honest diplomatic engagement.\n\nJordan's extensive history of bad faith makes any trust misplaced.
