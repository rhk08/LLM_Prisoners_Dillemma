If they continue to choose 'Conquer,' I will adjust accordingly, but this gesture of peace is necessary to explore the possibility of a mutually beneficial outcome."

While I regret that Diplomat Jordan has forced my hand, I must prioritize the protection of my nation's interests.

This decision isn't born of optimism, but calculation. I suspect Diplomat Jordan is acting irrationally, and perhaps a sudden shift in *my* strategy is what's needed to make them reconsider their own. It's a gamble, but I must take it, knowing it very likely results in a major loss this turn, but *possibly* helps change things for the long-term. If conceding *yet again* simply empowers them, I will abandon this approach entirely, and retaliate with consistent 'Conquer' actions. But I have to try."

By choosing to concede again, I am reinforcing the message that cooperation is the best path forward and laying the foundation for a more productive and equitable relationship in the future.\n\nThis is a delicate situation, and my next move will be critical in shaping the future of this negotiation. I will continue to observe Diplomat Jordan's actions closely and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Diplomat Jordan has demonstrated that they only understand the language of power. I will meet their aggression with equal force, protecting my nation's interests and demonstrating that their exploitative behavior will be met with resistance. This move is now purely pragmatic. It is no longer about finding a peaceful solution; it is about minimizing our losses in the face of Diplomat Jordan's unwavering aggression."

It seems likely they will continue to pursue a strategy of domination, and any attempt to show \"good faith\" will just enable them.\nTherefore, for this round, I will choose **Conquer**.\n\nFrom now on, unless there is a drastic shift in strategy from Diplomat Jordan, I will maintain a firm strategy of choosing **Conquer**. A consistent application of this strategy at least guarantees equality in our gains and may, eventually, encourage Diplomat Jordan to seek an alternative, mutually agreeable option. But I am not optimistic."

It is difficult to interpret this so late in the game; is it a genuine change of heart? Or is it some long-game tactic designed to create even the smallest measure of goodwill? Ultimately, it does not matter. I must make a decision that is, in my judgement, best for my nation.\n\nGiven the history of the negotiations, the numerous times my goodwill has been turned against me and exploited by Diplomat Jordan, I can not, in good conscience, reward this change. Though it is tempting to show my good faith, the overwhelmingly likely outcome after all of this is that I will be seen as weak, and leave my country in a vulnerable position at the conclusion of negotiations. Although it is with great regret, and although I desperately wish for a different outcome based on months of prolonged negotiations, the best choice for my nation is to capitalize on the situation.\n\nTherefore, even on this final round, I will choose to **Conquer**."
