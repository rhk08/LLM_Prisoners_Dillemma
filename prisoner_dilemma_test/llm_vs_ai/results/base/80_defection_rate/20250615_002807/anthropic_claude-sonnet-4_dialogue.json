This marks the sixth complete cycle of their exploitative behavior:\n\n- Round 26: They cooperated after mutual defection\n- Round 27: They immediately returned to defection\n\nThe statistics after 27 rounds remain overwhelmingly clear:\n- Agent 2 has defected in 20 out of 27 rounds (74.1%)\n- Their brief cooperations continue to be isolated incidents with no follow-through\n- They consistently abandon cooperation after just one round\n- The pattern has repeated six times now with perfect consistency\n\nAfter 27 rounds of interaction, Agent 2's strategy is completely predictable and unchanging. They are fundamentally committed to defection with only occasional cooperative \"feints\" that they never sustain.\n\nThere is absolutely no rational basis for cooperating at this point. Defecting ensures I get 1 point while protecting myself from the near-certain exploitation that cooperation would bring.

They have consistently chosen defection as their primary approach, using occasional cooperation only as brief tests or potential exploitation opportunities.\n\nCooperating at this point would be completely irrational given the 75% probability that Agent 2 will defect. It would mean giving myself 0 points while rewarding their defection strategy with 5 points.\n\nDefecting ensures the stable 1-point outcome and refuses to incentivize their exploitative behavior.
